## cloak browser (Rust + Wry/WebView2)

Local-first minimal desktop browser focused on privacy. Runs entirely on your machine, embeds the system WebView (Edge WebView2 on Windows), and stores state locally.

### Features
- Tabs with persistent session (up to 30 tabs)
- Address bar with search (DuckDuckGo by default)
- Always-on-top tab bar rendered via shadow DOM so sites cannot hide it
- Persistent cookies/localStorage/cache (WebView2 profile)
- No telemetry, no external analytics

### Requirements
- Rust (stable)
- Windows 10/11 with the Microsoft WebView2 Runtime installed
  - Download: [WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)

### Build and Run
```powershell
cd minimal_browser
cargo run
```

Build a release binary:
```powershell
cargo build --release
```

Default homepage is DuckDuckGo. Use the address bar to navigate or search. The tab bar stays pinned to the top.

### Persistence (where data is stored)
- App data directory (profile, tabs/bookmarks/history):
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%/com/minimal/browser/` (from Rust `directories::ProjectDirs::data_dir()`)
  - File: `profile.json`
- WebView (cookies/localStorage/cache):
  - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/com/minimal/browser/wv2_profile/` (set via `WEBVIEW2_USER_DATA_FOLDER`)

You can back up or clear session data by copying/deleting these folders/files while the app is closed.

### Controls
- Address bar: type a URL (adds `https://` if missing) or a search query
- Go button or Enter: navigate the active tab
- + Tab: open a new tab (limit 30)
- √ó on a tab: close the tab

### Configuration
- Start page: change `start_url` in `src/main.rs` if you prefer a different homepage
- UI: the injected UI is in `src/ui.js`. Tweak styles/behavior there

### Troubleshooting
- Build errors like ‚ÄúAccess is denied (os error 5)‚Äù: close the running browser window before rebuilding
- Message ‚ÄúFailed to unregister class Chrome_WidgetWin_0. Error = 1412‚Äù: benign Chromium shutdown log; safe to ignore
- If the tab bar isn‚Äôt visible on a particular site, it‚Äôs likely due to restrictive CSP. The app‚Äôs UI is injected with a shadow DOM to avoid most clashes, but if you hit a problem site, open an issue or switch the start page, and we‚Äôll consider moving the bar to a native (non-injected) layout

### Security & Privacy Notes
- This app itself does not add trackers or analytics
- Sites you visit still run their own code; use your preferred privacy settings and blockers at the network/OS level if needed

### Project Structure
- `src/main.rs`: Rust app entry, WebView and persistence wiring
- `src/ui.js`: UI logic for the tab bar, address bar, IPC to save profile

No license specified yet. Add one if you plan to distribute.

# Minimal Privacy Browser

A lightweight, privacy-focused web browser built with Rust and WebView technology.

## Features

- **Fast & Lightweight**: Built with Rust for performance and memory safety
- **Privacy-First**: Minimal data collection and tracking protection
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface with dark/light themes
- **Settings panel**: Startup mode (Restore/Home), default search engine, home page
- **Adjustable UI**: Font size/weight sliders and compact/comfortable density

- ‚úÖ Request size limits
- ‚úÖ Command whitelisting

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ ([Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/))

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd minimal_browser
cargo build --release
```

### Run

cargo run "search query"
```

## Configuration

## Roadmap

### Security Enhancements
- [ ] Certificate pinning
- [ ] DNS-over-HTTPS support
- [ ] Enhanced sandboxing
- [ ] Malware protection
- [ ] Phishing detection
- [ ] Encrypted storage

### Privacy Features
- [ ] Basic ad blocking (filter lists)
- [ ] Tracker blocking
- [ ] Incognito mode
- [ ] Privacy controls
- [ ] Data export/import

### UX / Features
- [ ] Per-site controls (JS, images, cookies)
- [ ] Native download manager
- [x] Startup behavior: Open home page / Restore last session (toggle)
- [x] Default search engine switcher in Settings (DDG, Google, Bing, Brave)
- [ ] Home page editor

### Persistence
- [x] Session restore persisted to `profile.json` via IPC
- [x] Periodic autosave and save-on-exit
- [ ] Migrate old localStorage data into `profile.json`

## How it works (IPC bridge)
- On startup, Rust reads `profile.json` and injects it into the page as `window.__MB_INITIAL__`.
- The UI updates state and preferences, then sends `window.ipc.postMessage({ cmd: 'profile_save', payload })` to persist.
- On Windows the runtime is WebView2 (Edge engine) with a modern user‚Äëagent.

### Performance
- [ ] HTTP/2 support
- [ ] Compression handling
- [ ] Advanced caching
- [ ] Memory optimization
